  <p>Now more than ever, more and more people are awakening. </p>
  <p>It’s no denying that you’re one of them, especially since you’re here right now.</p>
  
<p>There’s always been a part of you that knows that there’s so much more available here in this earthly realm for you to experience and accomplish. </p>
  
  <p>The relationships that you’ve built so far may lack the depth that you truly desire. </p>
  
  <p>You’re not able to enjoy life to its fullest because you haven’t tapped into your natural right to an abundant life -- in all forms, not just when it comes to wealth! </p>
  
  <p>Finally, you always knew you could be healthier, but every new diet or fitness program you try seems to go against the grain rather than encourage you to stay on track for the long haul. </p>
  
  <p>Don’t worry, you’re not the only one that feels like this -- especially considering the crazy times we’re in. </p>
  
  <p>In fact, the majority of us feel this way. </p>
  
  <p>This longing for more…</p>
  
  <p>It’s something that you can’t always put into words, but you’ve definitely felt it before. </p>
  
  <p>But what if you came across something that not only was able to explain this nudge towards something more, but also illuminated your path to get there?</p>
  
  <p>Actually, such a thing exists and it’s called your Personalized Soul Path Report. </p>

  <h2 class="tac fs44 mt10">To turn up your metabolism <br class="hidemobile" />whenever you want.</h2>
	
  <img src="images/healtheffects.png" alt="" class="white-border" />
 
<p>By the way, my name is Matt Stirling.</p>
  <img src="images/matt-family.jpg" alt="" class="alignright white-border mattfamily" />
<p>I studied health and fitness at Fanshawe College in London, Ontario…</p>
<p>I owned my own performance fitness and training studio for over 8 years...</p>
<p>And for the past 16 years…</p>
<p>I've trained and consulted with <strong>tens of thousands of women and men</strong> all over the world…</p>
<p>Using my unique yet highly effective fat-burning secrets.</p>
<p>Now I live with my beautiful wife Nubbia and our three lovely children...</p>
<p>Trying to be the best dad I can be…</p>
<p>My clients call me <strong>the "metabolism guy"</strong> because that's what I'm obsessed with.</p>
<p>Figuring out why some people have sky high metabolisms that burn fat around the clock…</p>
<p>While others can gain a pound just looking at a slice of pizza.</p>
<p>And what I found…</p>
<p>After stumbling upon this new breakthrough scientific research…</p>
<p>Along with a trip to a tiny village in Ecuador…</p>
<p>...to visit my vibrant and energetic 99 year old grandma-in-law</p>
<p>Is <strong>the key to turning on your metabolism</strong> whenever you want…</p>
<p>In a matter of seconds…</p>
<p>And it works no matter what your diet is…</p>
<p>How little you exercise…</p>
<p>Or how old you are.</p>
<p>It's all based on human biology...</p>
<h2 class="tac"><strong>And the secret starts with a NEW protein enzyme that <span class="red">targets abdominal fat</span> (<em>according to doctors</em>)</strong></h2>
	
  <img src="images/boost-ampk.png" alt="" class="white-border" />
<p>I refer to it as your <strong>"metabolism switch"</strong>...</p>
<p>But the scientific name for it is AMP-activated protein kinase…</p>
<p>Or <strong>AMPk</strong> for short.</p>

<div class="joinbox">
<p class="fs24"><span class="highlight">It's <strong>the genetic master switch</strong> that controls our metabolism.</span></p>
<p class="fs21"><em><strong>And when it's activated...</strong></em></p>
	<ul class="goldcheck">
		<li><p class="fs21">It can speed up even the slowest metabolisms…</p></li>
		<li>
	  <p class="fs21">And help to support cardiovascular health…</p></li>
	</ul>
</div>
	
<p class="fs24">According to Dr. Barry Sears, <span class="red"><strong>activating AMPk is the secret to a longer and better life</strong></span><sup>[23]</sup>.</p>
	
	<img src="images/poundstolose.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft white-border poundstolose" />
<p>The <strong>problem</strong> is...</p>
  
<p>Like air conditioning in the middle of winter…</p>
<p><u>Most of us have it turned off</u>.</p>
<p>So if you have 15 or more pounds to lose…</p>
<p>If you have more fat around your stomach than you want...</p>
<p>If you have cellulite..</p>
<p>Flabby arms…</p>
<p>A belly pooch…</p>
<p>Then it's a clear sign <strong>your AMPk pathway isn't working right</strong>.</p>
	
  <h2 class="tac mb0 darkbg shadow">The Good News Is...</h2>
	<p class="fs24 tac mt10 darkred">All you have to do is <strong>figure out how to flick this little switch...</strong></p>
	
	<img src="images/running.jpg" alt="" class="alignright white-border" />
<p>And everything else will fall into place.</p>
	<ul class="arrow">
		<li><p>You'll be at the exact weight you want to be at…</p></li>
		<li><p>You'll fit into the perfect size jeans…</p></li>
	    <li><p>All your clothes will fit just the way you want them to…</p></li>
		<li><p>You'll have more than enough energy...<p>
			<p>...to do everything you've always wanted to do.</p></li>
		<li><p>Your libido will be back…</p></li>
		<li><p>And you'll no longer think that everyone is staring at you the moment you walk into a room.</p></li>
	</ul>
	
    <p class="fs24"><em><strong>Even better...</strong></em></p>
	<ul class="arrow">
		<li><p>You never have to go on a restrictive calorie-counting diet ever again…</p></li>
		<li><p>You never have to do another second of cardio…</p></li>
		<li><p>And you don't have to force yourself to eat more vegetables.</p></li>
	</ul>
    <p>Because none of those things activate AMPk.</p>
  <p>Hopefully you can feel the weight being lifted off your shoulders…</p>
    <p>Because you don't have to stress about those things anymore.</p>
    <h2 class="tac">All you have to do is <br>
    focus on this one thing...</h2>
    <p>Turning on the "metabolism switch" inside your body.</p>
    <p>That's it.</p>
    <p>Nothing else matters.</p>
  <p>You can let yourself off the hook.</p>
    <p>Because I'm going to show you exactly how to do this…</p>
    <p>In as little as three seconds.</p>
	<img src="images/waffles.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft white-border waffles" />
    <p>You can do it in the morning…</p>
	
    <p>Or before you go to bed.</p>
	
<p>You can do it after a big carby breakfast of pancakes and waffles…</p>
    <p>Or after your bedtime bowl of ice cream.</p>
    <p>It works every time…</p>
    <p>And like anything…</p>
  <p>The more often you do it…</p>
    <p>The better your results will be.</p>
    <h2 class="tac">But First I Have To Tell You Something That Most Doctors Don't Want You To Hear</h2>
    <p>Because it flies in the face of everything you've ever known about losing fat.</p>
    <p>AMPk is an enzyme found in our cells.</p>
    <p>It's there…</p>
    <p>Just waiting to be turned on.</p>
    <p>And it plays a critical role in our energy metabolism…</p>
    <p>Which is simply the rate at which your body burns fat and calories.</p>
    <p><strong>Specifically, AMPk helps convert sugar and fat into energy, while decreasing hunger.</strong></p>
  <p>So not only are you burning more fat…</p>
    <p>But your hunger goes down as well.</p>
    <h2 class="tac">That's key because if you've ever <br>
    been on a calorie-restricted diet...</h2>
    <p>You probably felt hungry all the time.</p>
    <p>Which is why crash diets are never sustainable.</p>
    <p>The secret is... </p>
    <p class="tac fs21"><span class="highlight"><strong>You want to burn fat AND decrease your hunger at the same time.</strong></span></p>
	<img src="images/jeans2.jpg" width="300" height="450" alt="" class="alignright" />
<p>That way you aren' replying on "willpower" to say no to your favorite foods.</p>
    <p>You simply won't be hungry all the time...</p>
    <p>And that's the power of AMPk.</p>
    <p>However, there's one thing nearly everyone does…</p>
    <p>That we've been told is "healthy" for years…</p>
    <p>And yet, it KILLS AMPk on the spot.</p>
    <p>When you stop doing this…</p>
  <p>AMPk will soar like an airplane taking off from the runway.</p>
    <p>Flooding your body and burning up the fat in its way.</p>
    <h2 align="center"><strong>Your Body Can't Produce AMPk <br>
    in the Presence Of Fructans</strong></h2>
    <p>Fructans are polymers of fructose (<em>aka sugar</em>)...</p>
    <p>Now, this isn't just any type of regular sugar...</p>
  <p>Fructans are found in many "healthy" fruits, vegetables, and legumes.</p>
    <p>Simply put...</p>
    <p><strong>Fructans are a type of carbohydrate…</strong></p>
    <p>Made by a chain of fructose molecules strung together.</p>
    <p>Here's why they can be a problem…</p>
    <p>The body is not perfect at breaking down all parts of food.</p>
    <p>And not all humans have enough of the essential enzyme necessary to break apart the fructose polymers.</p>
    <p>So when you eat foods high in fructans…</p>
  <p>Your body <strong>struggles</strong> to break them down.</p>
    <h2 align="center"><strong>Now, here's the kicker…</strong></h2>
    <p>When you eat fructans…</p>
    <p>You get a big blood sugar spike.</p>
    <p>Even if those fructans are found in "healthy" foods like veggies or beans.</p>
    <p>As your blood sugar rises…</p>
    <p>Your body has to put this sugar somewhere.</p>
    <p>And since it's hard for most people to break down fructans…</p>
    <p>The fructose just gets shuttled into your fat cells.</p>
  <p>Which leads to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Increased weight gain</li>
      <li>Stomach bloating</li>
      <li>And puffiness    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>These hidden sugars not only cause your blood sugar to spike…</p>
    <p>It also forces your body to release <strong>insulin</strong>…</p>
    <p>Which is <u>your #1 fat-storing hormone</u>.</p>
    <p><strong>It's almost impossible to burn fat in the presence of insulin…</strong></p>
    <p>Because <span class="red"><strong>insulin BLOCKS AMPk</strong>.</span></p>
    <p>So if you're eating 5-6 small meals a day…</p>
  <p>You're blocking AMPk from being released…</p>
    <h2 align="center"><strong>That's the real reason why <br class="hidemobile" />
  you aren't burning any fat</strong></h2>
    <p>Even if you're snacking on carrot sticks...</p>
	<img src="images/bellyfat.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft white-border bellyfat" />
<p>Having a giant salad full of veggies for lunch..</p>
    <p>Or a plant-based black bean burger for dinner…</p>
    <p>They all BLOCK AMPk from being released, so you're not burning any fat.</p>
    <p>As I mentioned before…</p>
    <p>Fructans are made up of fructose polymers.</p>
    <p>Fructose is a special type of sugar that has to be processed and stored in the liver.</p>
    <p>Which means it can <strong>kick you out of fat-burning</strong> in seconds.</p>
    <p>While you can store hundreds of grams of sugar in your muscles…</p>
    <p>You can only store <strong>30-50 grams</strong> in your liver.</p>
    <p>If you eat more than that…</p>
    <p>And just to be clear, the average American eats <strong>over 300 grams</strong> per day…</p>
    <p>Because there's no more room in your liver…</p>
    <p>The rest just "spills over" and ends up in your fat cells.</p>
    <p>Think of it like this…</p>
    <p>If you fill your car up with gas…</p>
    <p>And you just let it run…</p>
    <p>The gas will eventually overflow and spill all over the ground.</p>
  <p>It's the same thing with extra fructose in your body…</p>
    <p>Except it spills into your fat cells.</p>
    <h2 align="center"><strong>Making your stomach, waist and <br class="hidemobile" />
    thighs bigger and full of cellulite.</strong></h2>
    <p>And once the extra fructose is in your fat cells…</p>
    <p>It's extremely difficult to get it out.</p>
    <p>Which is why it's so hard to lose fat as you get older.</p>
    <p>And when you consume too much fructose…</p>
    <p>You put your liver in an overwhelmed state…</p>
    <p>You spike your cholesterol…</p>
    <p>And your triglycerides…</p>
    <p>Which means you're going to make a tremendous amount of visceral fat.</p>
    <p>Visceral fat is the most dangerous type of fat…</p>
    <p>Because you can't see it.</p>
  <p>It's the fat that builds up around your heart and clogs your arteries.</p>
    <h2 class="tac"><span class="red"><strong>What Most People Don't Know Is…</strong></span><br>
      <strong>Fructans Are Hiding In Some Of Today's "Healthiest" Plant-Based Foods &amp; Vegetables</strong></h2>
    <p>Have you ever gone on a diet…</p>
    <p>Maybe you started eating a salad for lunch every day…</p>
  <p>You cut out the fast food…</p>
    <p>And yet, you still didn't lose that much weight?</p>
	<img src="images/salad2.jpg" alt="" class="alignright white-border" />
<p>Or maybe you didn't lose any at all?</p>
    <p>Well, it turns out that <strong>a handful of "healthy" vegetables are extremely high in fructans</strong>.</p>
    <p>Now, before I tell you what they are…</p>
    <p>I want to be perfectly clear.</p>
    <p>I'm <u>not</u> telling you to avoid all vegetables.</p>
    <p>If you're eating these veggies and getting great results…</p>
    <p>...then stick with it!</p>
    <p>It's clearly working for you.</p>
    <p>However, if weight loss is always an uphill battle for you…</p>
    <p>It might be from these high sugar veggies…</p>
    <p>That are stopping your body from burning fat.</p>
    <p>When it comes to fructans…</p>
  <p>The top sources are <strong>onions</strong>, <strong>cabbage</strong>, <strong>broccoli</strong> and <strong>asparagus</strong>.</p>
    <p>And another plant-based food that tops this list are legumes and beans.    </p>
    <h2 class="tac"><strong>That Means You Could Be Eating <br class="hidemobile" />
    Plenty of Veggies That Are Stopping <br class="hidemobile" />
    You From Burning Fat</strong></h2>
    <p>Again, if you're eating fast food around the clock…</p>
    <p>Then switching to these veggies would be a great first step.</p>
    <p>But once you're eating a relatively balanced diet…</p>
    <p>And the fat still isn't coming off…</p>
    <p>Fructans and these high-sugar veggies may be to blame.</p>
    <p>Because in the presence of fructans…</p>
    <p>AMPk can't be activated.</p>
    <p><strong>Which leaves your metabolism slow like a snail all day long.</strong></p>
    <p>You see...</p>
    <p>What's healthy for one person isn't always healthy for someone else.</p>
    <p>So while you're loading up on the beets, broccoli, bananas and peas…</p>
    <p>It could be what's stopping you from losing inches as quickly as you'd like.</p>
  <p>Even worse...</p>
    <h2 class="tac darkbg shadow"><strong>As We Age Your Body Naturally <br class="hidemobile" />
    Produces Less AMPk</strong></h2>
    <p>Which is why your metabolism slows down with every year that passes…</p>
    <p>Leading to more fat build-up…</p>
  <p>And loss of lean muscle tissue.</p>
    <p class="fs30 tac darkred mt10">Have you realized how most people <strong>gain weight</strong> <br class="hidemobile" />and <strong>get weaker</strong> into their 50's and beyond?</p>
    <img src="images/elbow.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft white-border elbow" />
  <p>Well, now you know why.</p>
	
<p>If you're consistently gaining weight…</p>
    <p>Even if it's just a pound or two every month…</p>
    <p>Your body probably isn't producing any AMPk.</p>
    <p>It's like trying to drive a car without any gas in the tank.</p>
    <p>It just sits there…</p>
    <p>Stalled.</p>
    <p>Now, let's take this one step further so you really understand this…</p>
    <p>Because when you do…</p>
  <p>Then we can talk about how to fix it.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><strong>As The Size Of Your Fat Cells Increase…</strong></h2>
    <p>Your body releases a substance called resistin.</p>
    <p>Which is the perfect name…</p>
    <p>Because it basically "resists" your body from losing weight.</p>
    <p>Resistin blocks AMPk activity <sup>[1]</sup>.  </p>
  <div class="tealbox">
    <p>So you eat foods that are high in fructans… </p>
      <p>Your body releases insulin and resistin… </p>
      <p>Both insulin and resistin block AMPk from being released… </p>
      <p>And your metabolism stays slow… </p>
      <p>The fructose gets shuttled to your liver </p>
      <p>And when there's too much where the liver can't store all of it… </p>
      <p>It "spills over" into your fat cells. </p>
      <p>Leading to a bigger stomach… </p>
      <p>Larger thighs… </p>
      <p>And a bigger waist. </p>
    </div>
    <h2 align="center"><strong>Does All Of That Make Sense?</strong></h2>
    <p>And when your fat cells become too large...</p>
    <p>Weight gain increases.    </p>
    <p>But what scientists and doctors are finally starting to realize...</p>
    <p><strong>Is if you want to get the fat out of your cells…</strong></p>
    <p>And burn it off…</p>
    <p>It's really as simple as flipping your AMPk switch…</p>
    <p>And keeping it on as often as possible…</p>
    <p>For as long as possible.</p>
    <p>Because AMPk determines your body fat composition.</p>
  <p>Now, you're probably wondering…</p>
    <h2 align="center"><strong>How Do I Turn On My "Metabolism Switch"?</strong></h2>
    <p>Well, if you look at the traditional research, you're going to be disappointed.</p>
    <p>Because it's the same boring advice you've heard over and over again.</p>
    <p>For example, one way you can do it is through intense exercise.</p>
    <p>In studies, rigorous exercise has been shown to activate AMPk.</p>
	<img src="images/ropes.jpg" alt="" class="alignright white-border ropes" />
<p>But here's the problem…</p>
    <p>First, it only stays activated for a short amount of time.</p>
    <p>So unless you're doing intense exercise around the clock…</p>
    <p>...which I wouldn't recommend…</p>
    <p>Then it might not make a big difference.</p>
    <p>Plus, what I've found working with hundreds of women and men 50 and above…</p>
    <p>Is that intense exercise usually does more harm than good.</p>
    <p>It's easier to get injured…</p>
    <p>Or pull a muscle…</p>
    <p>And it's hard to stick with long term.</p>
  <p>Honestly, it's just not worth the risk.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><strong>You Could Also Try Restricting Calories</strong></h2>
    <p>In theory, when you eat less…</p>
    <p>Your body is supposed to produce more AMPk.</p>
    <p><strong>But here's the problem…</strong></p>
    <p><span class="highlight">You can't restrict calories for the rest of your life.</span></p>
    <p>I mean, you've probably tried that dozens of times already…</p>
    <p>And how has that worked out for you?</p>
	<img src="images/lettuce.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft white-border lettuce" />
<p>So while it's technically supposed to help…</p>
    <p>We all know that your body can't survive on only a couple hundred calories a day.</p>
    <p>Because when you're starving every day…</p>
    <p>And try to rely on your willpower to avoid the foods you love…</p>

	<img src="images/Matt-grandma.jpg" alt="" class="alignright white-border" />
    <p>After getting married, my wife and I went to visit her grandmother…</p>
	
<p>...who lived in the tiny village of Giron in Ecuador.</p>
    <p>In Giron, there are no paved roads…</p>
    <p>No skyscrapers…</p>
    <p>There isn't even a grocery store.</p>
    <p>They live off the land…</p>
    <p>And make everything by hand.</p>
    <p>When we got there, I noticed something strange.</p>
    <p>Everyone was not only thin…</p>
    <p>They all looked incredibly young.</p>
    <p>In a village full of people in their 70's, 80's and 90's…</p>
    <p>Most of them didn't look a day over 40.</p>
    <p>I couldn't believe it.</p>
  <p>And one morning, I followed Nubbia's grandma on her morning routine.</p>
  <h2 class="tac"><strong>At 99, she'd walk to a small patch of land about 7 miles outside her village…</strong></h2>
    <img src="images/rainbow.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft white-border rainbow" />
<p>No cane…</p>
  <p>No wheelchair...</p>
    <p>And with her straw basket in hand…</p>
    <p>She'd pick these tiny plants one by one.</p>
    <p>I had no idea what they were.</p>
    <p>But when she had a full basket…</p>
    <p>We walked back to the village..</p>
    <p>Where she'd spend hours separating the plants.</p>
    <p>Then she'd grind them down by hand…</p>
    <p>Take a small pinch and put it in a cup...</p>
    <p>And pour hot water over them.</p>
    <p>Like an honest to goodness homemade tea.</p>
    <p>"<em>Why are you drinking that</em>?", I asked. </p>
  <p>She replied...</p>
    <h2 align="center"><strong>"<em>This Tea Keeps Me Young</em>"</strong></h2>
    <p>And who could argue with her.</p>
    <p>She's been drinking it every morning for over 50 years.</p>
    <p>And at 99, she's as sharp as a tack…</p>
    <p>She lives 100% independently on her own…</p>
    <p>No one is caring for her…</p>
    <p>And she looks like someone half her age.</p>
    <p>My curiosity was running wild...</p>
    <p>So when I got back home... </p>
    <p>I started researching the ingredients in my grandma-in-law's secret tea…</p>
    <p>And I quickly realized why everyone in the village... </p>
    <p>Was so thin... </p>
  <p>And looked so young.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><strong>A <span class="darkred">NEW Weapon</span> To Fight Excessive Weight</strong></h2>
    <p>The first plant extract my grandma-in-law used is called <strong>Berberine</strong>.</p>
	<img src="images/berberine.jpg" alt="" class="alignright white-border berberine" />
<p>Berberine is a bioactive compound that can be extracted from several different plants <sup>[7]</sup>.</p>
    <p>It's been tested in hundreds of different studies...</p>
    <p>And it has a long history of being used in traditional Chinese medicine…</p>
    <p>But the benefits go much deeper than that.</p>
    <p>One of the main actions of berberine is to activate AMPk <sup>[8]</sup>.</p>
  <p>In a study published in the journal <em>Diabetes</em>, it states…</p>
    <h3 align="center"><strong>"<em>Berberine reduced body weight and caused a <br>
    significant improvement in glucose tolerance <br>
    without altering food intake</em>."</strong></h3>
    <img src="images/biomedicine.png" alt="" class="white-border" />
    <p><strong>That means not only did it help with weight loss by triggering AMPk</strong>…</p>
    <p dir="ltr">It can also help support blood sugar levels already in normal range.  </p>
  <p>...without the test subjects changing their diet.</p>
    <h2 class="tac"><strong>That's key because if something <br class="hidemobile" />
    works
without you having to<br>
completely overhaul your diet…</strong></h2>
    <p>You're much more likely to stick with it.</p>
  <p>Berberine also helps <sup>[9, 10]</sup>:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Slow</strong> the breakdown of carbohydrates in the gut</li>
      <li>Support <strong>healthy blood sugar</strong> levels</li>
      <li>Support <strong>healthy  cholesterol </strong></li>
    </ol>
	<img src="images/loseweight.jpg" alt="" class="alignright white-border loseweight" />
<p>In a study of 37 women and men...</p>
<p>The participants took 300 mg. of berberine 3 times a day…</p>
    <p>As a result, they dropped their body mass index (BMI) levels from 31.5 to 27.4.</p>
    <p>They also lost belly fat…</p>
    <p>Their waists got smaller...    </p>
    <p>They also saw an improvement in fat-regulating hormones.  </p>
  <p>Without completely overhauling your diet.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <h2 align="center"><strong>The Next Ingredient Was <span class="darkred">Cinnamon Bark</span></strong></h2>
    <img src="images/Cinnamon-Bark2.png" alt="" class="white-border" />
  
<p>When I came across this one…</p>
	<img src="images/cinnamon.jpg" alt="" class="alignright white-border cinnamon" />
    <p>I just assumed it was regular cinnamon.</p>
    <p>Boy was I wrong.</p>
    <p><strong>Cinnamon bark is actually known as "true cinnamon"...</strong></p>
    <p>Because it's less common…</p>
    <p>And it's considered to be of superior quality than regular cinnamon.</p>
  <p>According to a study published in the <em>Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry…</em></p>
    <h2 class="tac"><strong>Cinnamon bark regulates the enzyme <br>
    AMPk</strong><strong>... <span class="red">to prevent cells from being <br>
    filled with fat.</span></strong></h2>
    <p>The result was a decrease in weight gain to those fed a high-fat diet.</p>
    <p>And in the <em>Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics</em>…</p>
    <p dir="ltr">Scientists report that this type of cinnamon helps support healthy insulin levels…    </p>
    <p>And reduces the accumulation of white fat <sup>[13]</sup>.</p>
  <p>This is the type of fat that "pads" your body.</p>
    <h2 class="tac"><strong>Rounding Out The List Were 4 Powerful Plant Extracts That Activate AMPk</strong></h2>
  <img src="images/pubmed.jpg" alt="" class="white-border" />
<p><strong><u>The first one is Alpha lipoic acid</u></strong>, which increases insulin sensitivity by activating AMPk in skeletal muscle <sup>[14]</sup>.</p>
  <img src="images/chromium.jpg" alt="" class="alignright white-border chromium" />
<p>It's also been shown to reduce body weight and increased fatty acid oxidation (aka fat-burning) <sup>[14]</sup>.</p>
<p><strong><u>Next was chromium</u></strong>…</p>
<p>An essential mineral that can increase the amount of AMPk in skeletal muscles…</p>
<p>Which positively impacts glucose metabolism in skeletal and heart muscles <sup>[15]</sup>.</p>
<p>It also helps support blood sugar levels that are already in the normal range<sup>[16]</sup>.</p>
<p>But what I found most interesting is this:</p>
<p>Most people who have tried to lose weight and keep it off…</p>
<p>...fail because of hunger and strong food cravings.</p>
<p>Well, in an 8-week study…</p>
<p>Taking 1,000 mg of chromium daily…</p>
<p><strong>Reduced food intake, hunger and cravings in healthy overweight women <sup>[17]</sup>.</strong></p>
<p>Which is extremely powerful, just think about it…</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>How many diets have you quit because<br>
you were hungry all the time…</strong></h2>
<p>Or the cravings just got too intense for you to ignore?</p>
<p>And imagine what you could do if that were no longer a problem for you?</p>
<p><strong><u>Next on the list was Bentotiamine</u></strong>.</p>
  <img src="images/bentotiamine.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft white-border bentotiamine" />
<p>Bentotiamine is a B vitamin that can help support a healthy inflammatory response <sup>[18]</sup>...</p>
<p>While helping activate AMPk in the body.</p>
<p><strong><u>And last on the list was naringin</u></strong>.</p>
<p>Naringin is really important because it's a flavonoid that helps activate AMPk <sup>[20]</sup>.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>And remember, when AMPk <br class="hidemobile" />
  in your body is high…</strong></h2>
<p>The body burns more fat at rest.</p>
<p>In other words, your fat-burning metabolism increases…</p>
<p>Even if you aren't dieting or exercising.</p>
<p>Whether you're 50 years old…</p>
<p>Or 80 years young.</p>
<p>And it remains sky high…</p>
<p>As long as you keep the AMPk pathway open.</p>

<h2 class="tac"><strong>When you close the AMPk pathway…</strong></h2>
  <img src="images/blueberries.jpg" alt="" class="alignright white-border blueberries" />
<p>By snacking all the time…</p>
<p>Eating oatmeal for breakfast...</p>
<p>Munching on high-sugar veggies…</p>
<p>Or eating bananas, apples, or oranges…</p>
<p>Your body <strong>stops burning fat…</strong></p>
<p>And starts shuttling sugar into your fat cells.</p>
<p>After researching all these different plant extracts…</p>
<p>I was on cloud nine.</p>
<p>I thought I finally had the recipe to end obesity as we know it. However...</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>I Had To See If It Actually Worked</strong></h2>
<p>Based on all the research…</p>
<p>If you could activate AMPk…</p>
<p><strong>It would essentially "turn on" your metabolism whenever you want.</strong></p>
<p>Which means your body will burn more calories and fat at rest.</p>
<p>And while most "experts" try to do this through intense exercise or strict diets…</p>
<p>Those aren't long term solutions because they're impossible to stick with.</p>
<p>But after my trip to Ecuador…</p>
<p>Seeing the thin youthfulness in my 99 year old grandmother-in-law…</p>
<p>I truly believed we could turn on your metabolism with a flick of a switch…</p>
<p>No matter your age</p>
<p>By using the same formula she had been using for decades.</p>
<p>I wanted to make it so easy and so convenient…</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>You could do it in less than <span class="red">3-seconds</span></strong></h2>
<p>So after spending weeks…</p>
<p>Talking with suppliers and manufacturers…</p>
  <img src="images/3seconds.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft white-border threeseconds" />
<p>I was able to source all the plant extract ingredients in bulk…</p>
<p>It wasn't cheap...</p>
<p>Or easy…</p>
<p>Because I was SUPER picky.</p>
<p>After all, the ingredients had to be:</p>
<ol style="overflow:hidden;">
  <li>100% plant based </li>
  <li>Without any fillers, additives, or chemicals</li>
  <li>Non-GMO</li>
</ol>
<p>It took months to get the formula just right…</p>
<p>And by the end of the year...</p>
<p>I had just enough in my life savings…</p>
<p>To get our first test batch…</p>
<p>In capsule form.</p>
<p>That way you could just pop it in your mouth... </p>
<p>Like your morning vitamin…</p>
<p>And move on with your day.</p>
<p>A little over a month later...</p>
<p>A package arrived at my door...</p>
<p>I ripped open the box as fast as I could.</p>
<p>Took one with a big glass of water. And..</p>
<h2 class="tac"><strong>Within 24 hours I felt a change</strong></h2>
<p>I wanted to put these plant extracts to the test…</p>
<p>So while I was taking them on a daily basis…</p>
<p>I was also eating a lot of high-carb meals.</p>
<p>You see…</p>
<p>Along with activating AMPk…</p>
<h2 class="tac"><strong>These extracts were also supposed to help stop carbs from being stored as fat.</strong></h2>
<p>That's the 1-2 punch that makes it so powerful.</p>
<p>Because if you can activate your fat-burning metabolism…</p>
<p>Without having to give up your favorite carbs…</p>
<p>While still losing weight…</p>
<h2 class="tac red"><strong>Then there's literally nothing <br class="hidemobile" />
  that could stop you.</strong></h2>
<p>So for the next few days…</p>
<p><strong>I went HARD on the carbs.</strong></p>
<p>Spaghetti, lasagna, breads, brownies, ice cream, you name it…</p>
  <img src="images/burger.jpg" alt="" class="alignright white-border burger" />
<p>Anything I could think of.</p>
<p>And <em>I didn't gain a single ounce</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, after the first 24 hours I <u>lost</u> a pound and a half.</p>
<p>And over the next 10 days…</p>
<p>My stomach started flattening out…</p>
<p>My face looked thinner…</p>
<p>My jeans were looser…</p>
<p>And I looked younger.</p>
<p>In the first month alone...</p>
<p>I was down <strong>12 pounds</strong> and <strong>two jean sizes</strong>.</p>
<p>I felt incredible. However...</p>
<h2 class="tac"><span class="red"><strong>The Biggest Change Came With My Wife Nubbia...</strong></span> <strong>After Having Twins</strong></h2>
<p>Honestly, my results were just icing on the cake.</p>
<p>The true test was with my wife Nubbia…</p>
<p>Who after having three kids…</p>
<p>And twins just a few months ago…</p>
<p>She was determined to get her body back…</p>
<p>But with the twins at home…</p>
<p>She didn't have time to go to the gym for an hour or two every day…</p>
<p>And after an 8-month pregnancy…</p>
<p>She didn't want to go on some unhealthy crash diet.</p>
<h2 class="tac"><strong>After the first week...</strong></h2>
<p>Nubbia lost 3 pounds...</p>
<p>But she didn't think anything of it.</p>
<p>Until later than night when something amazing happened.</p>
<p>She was emotionally drained after a long day of taking care of the twins.</p>
<p>And after putting them to bed…</p>
<p>She went straight for the emergency ice cream in the freezer.</p>
<p>And she ate it all.</p>
<p>Every last chocolatey spoonful.</p>
<h2 class="tac"><strong>But when she woke up the next morning…</strong></h2>
  <img src="images/nubbia1.jpg" alt="" class="alignright white-border nubbia1" />
<p>Something crazy happened.</p>
<p>Her stomach was already a bit flatter than it was the night before.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Remember, when AMPk is activated in your body…</p>
<p>It increases your fat-burning metabolism.</p>
<p>And the "true cinnamon" in my grandma-in-laws secret recipe…</p>
<p><strong>Helps block carbs from being stored as fat.</strong></p>
<p>We both looked at each other stunned.</p>
<p>Over the next few days…</p>
<p>Her cravings disappeared…</p>
<p>She wasn't hungry all the time anymore...</p>
<p>She was consistently losing weight like clockwork...</p>
<p>1lb, 3lbs, 1.5lbs, 2lbs.</p>
<p>Then one morning...</p>
<h2 class="tac"><strong>I woke up to the loudest <br class="hidemobile" />
  scream in the world.</strong></h2>
  <img src="images/nubbia2.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft white-border nubbia2" />
<p>I thought something happened to the twins…</p>
<p>But it wasn't a scream of terror…</p>
<p>It was an excited scream of joy.</p>
<p>There was Nubbia…</p>
<p>Standing on the scale…</p>
<p><strong>Down 14 pounds.</strong></p>
<p>All of her pregnancy fat had disappeared.</p>
<p>And shortly after...</p>
<p>She got all the way back down to her high school weight…</p>
<p>Which seemed impossible just a few months earlier.</p>
<p>It turns out...</p>
<h2 class="tac"><span class="red"><strong>We Finally Discovered The Secret…</strong></span><br class="hidemobile" />
  <strong>To Turning On Your Fat-Burning <br>
  Metabolism Whenever You Want</strong></h2>
<p>Remember…</p>
<p>When you activate AMPk in your body…</p>
  <img src="images/Nubbia-Drink.jpg" alt="" class="alignright white-border nubbiadrink" />
<p>Your cravings and hunger go way down.</p>
<p>And your metabolism shoots up.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever been around someone who always said no to treats?</strong></p>
<p>Maybe it was a co-worker…</p>
<p>Or one of your annoying "skinny friends".</p>
<p>You just assume they have a lot of willpower…</p>
<p>Or self-discipline…</p>
<p>Or maybe you think they don't love food as much as you do.</p>
<p>None of that's true.</p>
<p>They simply don't have the same cravings, urges, and intense hunger as you…</p>
<p>Because when AMPk is turned on…</p>
<p>Those cravings just don't exist.</p>
<p>You feel satisfied instead of hungry…</p>
<p>You feel content instead of cravings...</p>
<p>And since AMPk is sitting in your cells right now…</p>
<p>BEGGING to be used...</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>All you have to do is turn it on</strong></h2>
<p>And let it do the hard work for you.</p>
<p>That's what Nubbia and I did…</p>
<p>And we started dropping fat like crazy. </p>
<p>So we started giving it to all our friends and family…</p>
	<img src="images/friends-family.jpg" alt="" class="white-border" />
<p>None of them were very health conscious…</p>
<p>But they wouldn't mind dropping a few pounds IF it was easy.</p>
<p>I made it clear this wasn't some miracle formula…</p>
<p>Just something that helps your metabolism run like it's supposed to…</p>
<p>While allowing you to eat more carbs…</p>
<p>...without storing them as fat.</p>
<p>Within a week…</p>
<p>Our parents…</p>
<p>Aunts…</p>
<p>And uncles…</p>
<p>All in their 60's and beyond...</p>
<p>Were getting thinner…</p>
<p>With more youthful energy...</p>
<p>Without making drastic changes to their diet.</p>
<p>That's when I knew…</p>
<p>This really could work for anyone.</p>
<p>And it was now my duty..</p>
<p>To get this in the hands of as many people as possible.</p>
<p>I nicknamed it CarboFix…</p>
<p>Because it "fixes" the way your body processes carbs.</p>
<p>Using them for energy…</p>
<p>Instead of automatically storing them as fat.</p>
<p>And that's why...</p>

<h2 class="tac darkbg shadow"><strong>CarboFix Works On Three Unique Levels</strong></h2>
	
<div class="arrowbox">
	<h3><strong><span class="darkred">Step #1:</span> <br /><u>It helps turn ON AMPk in the body.</u></strong></h3>
</div>	
	

<p>Remember, AMPk is found inside every cell…</p>
<p>And serves as your body's "master regulating switch."</p>
  <img src="images/Nubbia-locker.jpg" alt="" class="alignright white-border nubbialocker" />
<p><strong>It determines your body fat composition…</strong></p>
<p>And how long you'll live.</p>
<p>Supplementing with Berberine…</p>
<p>Combined with the other plant extracts we discussed today…</p>
<p>Activates AMPk.</p>
<p>It also increases fat oxidation - aka fat-burning…</p>
<p>And decreases fat storage.</p>
<p>If you have 15 or more pounds to lose…</p>
<p>Your #1 priority is activating AMPk…</p>
<p>And the fact that it isn't activated yet in your own body…</p>
<p>Is one of the main reasons people gain fat as they get older.</p>
	

<div class="arrowbox">
	<h3><strong><span class="darkred">Step #2:</span> <br /><u>It Decreases Hunger &amp; Cravings</u></strong></h3>
</div>
<p>Think about how much easier it would be to lose weight…</p>
  <img src="images/step2.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft white-border step2" />
<p>If you didn't have any cravings or intense hunger.</p>
<p>You know, the kind where you literally can't stop yourself from giving in?</p>
<p>Before you know it…</p>
<p>You're standing in front of the pantry…</p>
<p>With a handful of cookies…</p>
<p>And you don't even remember how you got there…</p>
<p>Or how the cookies got into your hands.</p>
<p><strong>That's how powerful cravings can be.</strong></p>
<p>Yet when you naturally don't have those cravings…</p>
<p>And don't have to try and rely on willpower any longer…</p>
<p>Your mood improves…</p>
<p>Your energy goes way up…</p>
<p>And the fat starts coming off.</p>
<p>Because now you have AMPk activated…</p>
<p>So your body is naturally burning more fat for energy…</p>
<p>And you're no longer snacking or falling victim to sweets.</p>
<p><strong>Now can you see why this works so fast?</strong></p>
<p>You're finally getting out of your own way…</p>
<p>So your body can burn fat naturally like it's supposed to.</p>
	
	
<div class="arrowbox">
	<h3><strong><span class="darkred">Step #3:</span><br /> <u>It BLOCKS Carbs From Being Stored As Fat</u></strong></h3>
</div>	
<p>This is where most traditional diets fail.</p>
<p>I mean, how many different low carb diets are you going to try…</p>
<p>...before you realize that <strong>giving up carbs simply doesn't work for you?</strong></p>
<img src="images/food2.jpg" alt="" class="alignright white-border food2" />
<p>But now you can have your carbs as often as you want…</p>
<p>And you can thank chromium for that.</p>
<p>Chromium helps your body metabolize carbs like it did when you were younger.</p>
<p>Think of it like an air traffic controller…</p>
<p>It improves blood sugar levels by directing nutrients where they need to go in your body.</p>
<p>It's so powerful that in a 4 month trial... </p>
<p>A group of patients lowered insulin levels without changing their diets <sup>[21]</sup>.</p>
<p>And it even helps reduce cholesterol, increase brain health, improve skin, and protect bone health <sup>[22]</sup>. </p>
<h2 class="tac"><strong>Are You Starting To Understand Why <br class="hidemobile" />
  You've Struggled For So Long?</strong></h2>
<p>Most people over 50 years old…</p>
<p>Don't have AMPk activated in their body.</p>
<p>They also have intense cravings and hunger…</p>
<p>That never goes away.</p>
<p>Which leads them to eat lots of carbs…</p>
<p>...that end up getting stored as fat.</p>
<p>This cycle goes on and on for years…</p>
<p>Even decades…</p>
<p>And it's why obesity has become such a huge problem here in America.</p>
<p>But all that ends today.</p>
<h2 class="tac"><strong>The only reason this was <br class="hidemobile" />

<p>Was because <strong>no one took the time to do the research</strong>.</p>

<p>And piece this all together.</p>
<p>I can see why…</p>

<h2 class="tac"><strong>With These 5 Unique Plant Extracts You Can Finally "Turn On" Your Metabolism Whenever You Want</strong></h2>
<p>At this point you've heard about my story to Ecuador…</p>
  <img src="images/extracts.jpg" alt="" class="alignright white-border extracts" />
<p>How my grandma-in-law is young, thin, and 100% self-reliant…</p>
<p>...at 99 years old.</p>
<p>And how Nubbia dropped every last bit of pregnancy fat in record time…</p>
<p>Plus how thousands of women and men are raving…</p>
<p>...about a solution that takes less than 3 seconds a day…</p>
<p>And works when nothing else does.</p>
<p class="fs24 darkred"><strong>So let me ask you a question…</strong></p>
  <img src="images/woman.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft white-border woman" />
<p><strong>What will you see in the mirror two weeks from now?</strong></p>

<p>Because if you don't take the first step…</p>
<p>Then I fear that nothing will ever change.</p>

<p>You're losing precious time.</p>
<p>Time that you'll never get back.</p>
<p>Whatever life has been like for you…</p>

<h2 class="tac"><strong>We've Set Aside The Next 350 Bottles <br class="hidemobile" />
  For Readers Of This Letter <span class="red"><br class="hidemobile" />
  At An Extreme Discount</span></strong></h2>
<p>You see, we went through our initial 5,000 bottle test batch in less than 24 hours.</p>
<p>Once the word spread online…</p>
<p>Our site nearly crashed.</p>
<p>And once people realized how fast the bottles were going…</p>
<p>They started ordering six or more bottles at a time.</p>
<p>That way they can start burning fat right away…</p>
<p>And keep it going for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>It sounds crazy, but it makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Especially since there's so much research proving the benefits of AMPk…</p>
<p>And how it can slim down your body and cut back on cravings.</p>
<p>When the first few pounds start coming off…</p>
<p>You'll feel more motivated than ever…</p>
<p>And you'll want it to keep going.</p>
<p>However, since so many people are ordering three to six bottles at a time…</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>We're always at the risk of <br class="hidemobile" />
  running out of stock.</strong></h2>
<p>I mean, I'm just a former trainer from Canada…</p>
<p>I'm not some rich business tycoon with deep pockets…</p>
<p>So keeping inventory on hand and ready to go…</p>
<p>Has been one of my biggest challenges.</p>
<p>And when we run out…</p>
<p>You'll have to wait up to 3 months on average…</p>
<p>Because we're not going to cut corners.</p>
<h2 class="tac"><strong>We guarantee the freshest, cleanest plant extracts in every single bottle.</strong></h2>
<p>Each bottle of CarboFix is:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Manufactured in a CGMP facility approved of by the FDA</li>
  <li>Clinically validated by research-based doses</li>
  <li>Third party tested for quality assurance</li>
  <li>Manufactured using a unique "clean filtering" process to preserve the nutrients in each dose so they never become contaminated</li>
  <li>Made with 100% pure plant extracts</li>
</ol>
<p>This process is critical for producing the best plant extract on the market today...</p>
<p>And that takes time and resources.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Because we're not willing to cut corners…</p>
<p>Or compromise on quality…</p>
<p>We can only produce a certain number of bottles at a time.</p>
<h2 class="tac"><strong>And With So Much Research Showing <br class="hidemobile" />
  That the Longer You Use These <br class="hidemobile" />
  Unique Plant Extracts…</strong></h2>
<img src="images/Nubbia-lockerroom.jpg" alt="" class="alignright white-border lockerroom" />
<p>The more <strong>pounds</strong> you can see <strong>melt away</strong>…</p>
<p>The more your <strong>hunger naturally decreases</strong>…</p>
<p>The more your <strong>cravings fade away</strong>…</p>
<p>...especially at bedtime…</p>
<p>And the more fat your metabolism will burn…</p>
<p>It's easy to see why so many frustrated dieters are ordering several bottles at a time.</p>
<p>So they can remain stocked up…</p>
<p>And even give some to their family and friends…</p>
<p>...after they ask you what in the world you've been doing to get so thin.</p>
<h2 class="tac"><strong>Now, if you're wondering how <br class="hidemobile" />
  much you should take…</strong></h2>
<p>Start with one capsule about 30 minutes before your first meal…</p>
<p>And another one 30 minutes before dinner.</p>
<p>That way if you're going to have a higher-carb breakfast like pancakes or waffles…</p>
<p>Or maybe some pizza or spaghetti for dinner…</p>
<p>You'll give the plant extracts plenty of time to work their magic.</p>
<h2 class="tac"><strong>Now, if you want even faster results…</strong></h2>
<p>Here's what I've found works really well…</p>
<p>...especially for women who've been stalled for a two weeks or more.</p>
<p>Take one 30 minutes before lunch….</p>
<h2 class="tac red"><strong>As your "mid-day metabolism boost".</strong></h2>
<p>Think about it…</p>
<p>Let's say you want to buy a lottery ticket.</p>
<p>Are your chances to win better buying just one ticket…</p>
<p>Or 200?</p>
<p>Of course your chances of winning go up the more tickets you buy.</p>
<p>It's the same thing here…</p>
<p>The more you take, the faster it works.</p>
<p>Now, don't go overboard…</p>
<p>You don't need to take 20 a day.</p>
<p>But start taking them 30 minutes before each meal and snack…</p>
<p>For at least 30 days.</p>
<h2 class="tac"><strong>Here's Why It's Critical To <br class="hidemobile" />
  Commit To At Least 30 Days</strong></h2>
<p>No matter how many bottles you choose…</p>
	<img src="images/Matt-trainer.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft white-border matt-trainer" />
<p>Your shipment will be on it's way as soon as you place your order.</p>
  
<p>Depending on where you live, it usually takes 3-5 business days to arrive.</p>
<p>When the package gets dropped off at your door…</p>
<p>I'm sure you'll want to rip it open and try some right away.</p>
<p>So go ahead and take one with a glass of water.</p>
<p>Then do the same thing at night before dinner…</p>
<p>And the next morning.</p>
<p><span class="highlight"><strong>Most people notice a difference within the first 24 hours.</strong></span></p>
<p>Your hunger before bed will start to fade away…</p>
<p>You'll be satisfied after dinner without having to go back for seconds…</p>
<p>You won't be starving from the minute you wake up…</p>
<p>And while you can definitely still enjoy your sweets and treats…</p>
<p>You won't feel like they're controlling you.</p>
<h2 class="tac"><strong>Within the first month…</strong></h2>
<p>People will ask if there's "something different" about you…</p>
	
	<img src="images/Matt-Trainer-2.jpg" alt="" class="alignright white-border training"/>
<p>They'll probably ask what diet you're on…</p>
  
<p>Or if you've been exercising more…</p>
<p>Because you just look so good.</p>
<p>After 3 months, it'll be hard to even recognize you…</p>
<p>Especially for your friends and family who haven't seen you in a while.</p>
<p>They won't think you're the same person…</p>
<p>They'll do a "double take" when you walk in the room…</p>
<p>And after 6 months, you'll look like a completely different person.</p>
<p>Younger…</p>
<p>Thinner…</p>
<p>More vibrant…</p>
<p>With a glow that follows you everywhere you go.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>The More You Use It, The <br class="hidemobile" />
  More Effective It Will Be</strong></h2>
<p>Just like taking a multivitamin…</p>
<p>It's not going to do much if you take one a month…</p>
<p>But if you take one every morning…</p>
<p>It can really help bulletproof your body.</p>
<p>Think of this as your new daily defense…</p>
<p>Your shield against uncontrollable cravings, intense hunger, and sudden weight gain.</p>
<p>That's why I always recommend choosing at least 3 bottles to get started…</p>
<p>And 6 bottles if you're really serious about getting the weight off in record time.</p>
<p>A single bottle will get you started in activating AMPk in your body…</p>
<p>...probably for the first time since you were a kid.</p>
<p>You'll feel a rush…</p>
<p>That's your metabolism "burning up" your body fat.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Trust me, the first 30 days go by quick.</strong></h2>
<p>And continuing to use it for three months gives you the momentum you need…</p>
<p>To help reverse years of damage to your metabolism.</p>
<p>And when you commit for a full 6 months…</p>
<p>Something special happens.</p>
<p>You have control over your appetite…</p>
<p>Your body is firing on all cylinders…</p>
<p>Your cravings fade away and don't control you anymore…</p>
<p>Your stomach flattens out...</p>
<p>You feel better than you have in months…</p>
<p>Because your body and your metabolism are finally running like they're supposed to.</p>
<p>Plus..</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>The More You Stock Up, The More You Save</strong></h2>
<p>When you get a single bottle of CarboFix, it's only $49 a bottle…</p>
<p>Which is already a $50 savings.</p>
<p>And because our multiple bottle packages are our best sellers…</p>
<p>We set it up so that the more you buy, the more you save.</p>
<p>Because as a new small business owner…</p>
<p>I want you to save as much money as possible…</p>
<p>In hopes that you'll tell your friends if, and ONLY if, CarboFix works wonders for you.</p>
<p>That's why, if you choose the 6 bottle discounted package…</p>
<p>You'll pay just $34 a bottle.</p>
<p>Plus, we worked out a deal with our supplier...</p>
<p>So you'll get a big "new customer" discount on a three-month supply as well.</p>
<p>The savings aren't as big as the six-bottle discount…</p>
<p>But they're still significant.</p>
<p>And don't worry…</p>
<p>Whatever package you choose…</p>
<p>You will not be billed again unless you make another order.</p>
<p>I hate companies that keep sending you bottles when you didn't order them.</p>
<p>But you have to act fast…</p>
<p>Because our supply is running low.</p>
<p>And I can guarantee these discounts will not be available forever.</p>

<h2 class="tac"><strong>You Also Get the Following THREE Bonuses Absolutely <span class="red">FREE</span> When You Order Today</strong></h2>
<p>Making CarboFix a part of your daily routine is the first step to getting your body back.</p>
<p>However, I want to make sure you have everything you could possibly need to get the extra weight off…</p>
<p>As quickly as possible.</p>
<p>That's why I'm including the following 3 bonuses absolutely free…</p>
<p>...when you pick up your supply of CarboFix today.</p>
<p>However, these bonuses won't be available for long.</p>
<p>I can't even guarantee they'll be here tomorrow…</p>
<p>So make sure you grab them up now or risk missing out forever.</p>
<h2><span class="red"><strong>Free Bonus #1:</strong></span> <strong>10-Day Rapid Fat Loss Diet</strong></h2>
<img src="images/10dayrapidfatloss.png" alt="" class="alignleft bonusimg" />
<p>While you don't have to change your diet in order for CarboFix to work…</p>
<p>As a personal nutrition coach, I always recommend it.</p>
<p>That's because I don't just want you to lose a bunch of weight.</p>
<p>I want you to have a strong, healthy heart…</p>
<p>I want you to have healthy cholesterol levels…</p>
<p>And healthy blood pressure...</p>
<p>I want you to have lots of energy…</p>
<p>So you can be around well into your 70's, 80's even your 90's…</p>
<p>To watch your kids and your grandkids blossom.</p>
<p>And nutrition can play a big role in that.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>However, my approach is different than most.</strong></h3>
<p>I don't want you to starve yourself…</p>
<p>I don't want you skipping meals...</p>
<p>And I don't want you to count calories.</p>
<p>You don't have to go keto…</p>
<p>Low-carb…</p>
<p>Or plant-based either.</p>
<p>Over the years, I've come up with the most powerful flat-blly protocol…</p>
<p>...to get rid of the nagging fat in the shortest amount of time possible.</p>
<p>Inside, you'll discover:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The secret to eating LOTS of carbs that never get stored as fat</li>
  <li>The #1 fat-burning food to eat first thing in the morning</li>
  <li>What the world's top celebrities over 50 do to stay thin year round </li>
  <li>How to reprogram your body to burn fat while you sleep</li>
</ol>
<p>This isn't some low-carb or low-calorie diet plan.</p>
<p>But it is something doable that you can stick with long term…</p>
<p>So you don't just lose a bunch of weight, only to regain it a few weeks later.</p>
<p>This puts an end to rebound weight gain.</p>
<p>And in our test groups, the average weight loss  has been 8.5 pounds.</p>
<p>With the record being 16 pounds.</p>
<h2><span class="red"><strong>Free Bonus #2:</strong></span> <strong>24-Hour Fix</strong></h2>
<img src="images/24hourfix.png" alt="" class="alignleft bonusimg" />
<p>I don't know about you…</p>
<p>But I'm obsessed with getting FAST results.</p>
<p>That's why my personal clients pay me up to $3,000 a month…</p>
<p>Because after struggling for 5, 10 even 15 or more years…</p>
<p>They were willing to pay a pretty penny to get the fat off NOW.</p>
<p>Especially if they're older…</p>
<p>And their life is literally on the line.</p>
<p>So whenever I personally coach someone new…</p>
<p>We ALWAYS start with this 24-hour protocol.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>It's designed specifically to get those <br>
  first few pounds off as fast as possible.</strong></h3>
<p>Because once you prove to yourself that you can do this…</p>
<p>And that this WILL work for you…</p>
<p>Then there's nothing that can slow you down.</p>
<p>Getting started is always the hardest part…</p>
<p>Which is why if you commit to just 24 hours…</p>
<p>You won't feel overwhelmed…</p>
<p>And when the results start coming in…</p>
<p>You'll have the momentum and motivation to stick with it.</p>
<h2><span class="red"><strong>Free Bonus #3:</strong></span> <strong>50 Fat Blasting Red Smoothies</strong></h2>
<img src="images/50smoothies2.png" alt="" class="alignleft bonusimg" />
<p>One of the secrets my wife Nubbia used to get rid of the extra baby fat was…</p>
<p>Combining her morning CarboFix capsule with a delicious smoothie.</p>
<p>You see, with two baby twins at home…</p>
<p>She didn't have time to make a gourmet breakfast in the morning.</p>
<p>Heck, she didn't even have time to sit down and have some eggs.</p>
<p>So one morning, after changing dirty diapers…</p>
<p>And feeding the babies…</p>
<p>She was already exhausted…</p>
<p>And needed a pick-me-up.</p>
<p>So she started throwing whatever we had in the fridge into the blender.</p>
<p>At first, it tasted pretty nasty.</p>
<p>I mean, she was severely sleep deprived after all.</p>
<p>However, over the next few weeks… </p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>She started finding the exact right mix of healthy <br>
  protein, good fats, and smart carbs....</strong></h3>
<p>That helps the body burn more fat…</p>
<p>...while giving her the energy she needed to make it through the day.</p>
<p>And we found a few common household ingredients…</p>
<p>That made the smoothies taste absolutely delicious.</p>
<p>Because if you're just drinking blended up veggies…</p>
<p>It can taste pretty gross.</p>
<p>So we took the absolute BEST 50 belly blasting smoothie recipes…</p>
<p>That you can make in less than 3 minutes…</p>
<p>With clean ingredients you probably have in your fridge right now…</p>
<p>And put it into a full-color smoothie recipe book…</p>
<p>That you can get free of charge when you try CarboFix today.</p>

<h2 class="tac"><strong>Look...You Only Have Two Options <br>
  Right Now... </strong> <span class="red"><strong>That Lead To Two <br>
  VERY Different Results</strong></span></h2>
<p>Unfortunately our time here together is almost over…</p>
<p>And going forward, you really only have two options.</p>
<p><strong><u>Option #1</u></strong> is you can take everything you learned here today…</p>
<p>And try to apply it yourself.</p>
<p>You can spend weeks trying to find the exact plant extracts…</p>
<p>In the exact right quantities…</p>
<p>You can go to all your local grocery stores…</p>
<p>You can spend hours searching for them online…</p>
<p>And if you do find them, you can figure out how to mix them together in a way that actually works.</p>
<p>But let's be honest.</p>
<p>That's going to take A LOT of time…</p>
<p>And work..</p>
<p>And effort.</p>
<p>Plus, life will get in the way like it always does…</p>
<p>And in a month, you'll probably be in the same exact place you are now.</p>
<p>That's not what I want for you.</p>
<p><strong><u>Option #2</u></strong> is you can take the easy way out…</p>
<p>Take advantage of all the hard work I've already done…</p>
<p>And see how powerful these plant extracts are... </p>
<p>Once you get them in your hands.</p>
<p>All you need is a few seconds in the morning to start seeing the amazing benefits…</p>
<p>And with all the free bonuses…</p>
<p>30 days from now…</p>
<p>You can be thinner…</p>
<p>Skinnier…</p>
<p>With way more energy…</p>
<p>Your pants sliding off your waist…</p>
<p>You'll probably start making more trips to Goodwill…</p>
<p>...donating all the clothes that are way too big and way too loose on your body.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>But you have to take the first step.</strong></h2>
<p>Look, if you can clean up your diet on your own…</p>
<p>And start exercising every single day…</p>
<p>While sticking with it long enough to actually see results...</p>
<p>Then you clearly don't need my help.</p>
<p>However, if you want a helping hand…</p>
<p>If you want me to help guide you along the way…</p>
<p>So you don't have to do this alone…</p>
<p>While finally getting the missing link…</p>
<p>...the unique plant extracts that can make all the difference in the world…</p>
<p>Then the choice seems pretty clear.</p>
<p>Plus, if for some reason it doesn't work out…</p>
<p>You can just let us know…</p>
<p>And we'll refund your entire investment.</p>
<p>So you have nothing to lose…</p>
<p>And an exciting, youthful life to gain.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> After our initial test batch of 5,000 bottles sold out so fast…</p>
<p>We started getting questions from all over the world…</p>
<p>Which I've answered below.</p>
<h3><strong>What's CarboFix again?</strong></h3>
<p>CarboFix is the breakthrough carb control supplement featuring true cinnamon and other powerful ingredients to prevent weight gain, increase fat loss, and help activate AMPk in the body. </p>
<p>AMPk helps increase metabolism and reduce abdominal fat.</p>
<p>CarboFix is comprised of five unique plant extracts that help activate AMPk, which includes Berberine, True Cinnamon, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Naringin, Benfotiamine, and Chromium.</p>
<h3><strong>When can I expect to see results?</strong></h3>
<p>Everyone's body is different, so it's hard to say exactly when you'll see results. On average, most women and men see positive results within the first 72 hours.</p>
<p>Whether that's losing those first few pounds, noticing your jeans fitting looser around your waist, having more energy, or just feeling lighter overall.</p>
<p>As with anything, the longer you do it, the better results you'll receive. When you stick with it for 30 days, you'll start looking and feeling like a whole new person.</p>
<p>Within 3 months, your friends may not even recognize you.</p>
<p>And within 6 months, people talk about being a whole new person, who looks, feels and moves like someone half their age.</p>
<h3><strong>How do I know if CarboFix is right for me?</strong></h3>
<p>That's a great question because CarboFix is definitely not for everyone.</p>
<p>If you have 15 or more pounds to lose and your body seems resistant to diet and exercise…</p>
<p>And if your metabolism seems really slow because you can never lose weight even though you eat pretty healthy…</p>
<p>Then CarboFix is for you.</p>
<p>The odds are, AMPk is not activated inside your body. </p>
<p>That's because it can be blocked by certain carbs, fruits, and even high-sugar vegetables that most people wouldn't suspect.</p>
<p>Luckily, you can turn that around in just a few seconds a day.</p>
<h3><strong>How can I place my first order?</strong></h3>
<p>Simply choose the package you'd like below. Once you've done that, click the Add to Order button.</p>
<p>You'll be taken to our 100% secure order form. Once you've filled that out, your shipment will be on it's way.</p>
<p>It usually takes 3-5 business days to arrive, depending on your location. </p>
<p>And you'll receive instant access to all the free bonuses, including the 10-Day Fat Flush, the Fat Blasting Smoothie Recipes, and the 24-Hour Fix protocol.</p>
<p>You'll also receive an email with our customer service contact information. That way you can track your order. And you can reach out to us if you have any questions at all.</p>
<p>Remember, I'm here to help you. So please don't hesitate to reach out.</p>

<h3><strong>Is CarboFix gluten free?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes. Gluten free. Soy free. Dairy Free. GMO free. No MSG either.</p>
<h3><strong>What constitutes as one serving of CarboFix? </strong></h3>
<p>One serving of CarboFix is two capsules. </p>
<h3><strong>How does your money back guarantee work</strong>?</h3>
<p>If for whatever reason you're unsatisfied with CarboFix and all the free bonuses…</p>
<p>Simply contact our customer service team and we'll give you a full and prompt refund with no questions asked, once you've returned the bottles. Our Customer service team will direct you on how to do so to make it easy for you.</p>
<p>It's our way of saying thank you for giving CarboFix an honest try.</p>
<h3><strong>Will CarboFix work for someone my age? </strong></h3>
<p>Yes, CarboFix has worked for women and men in their 40's, 50's, 60's…</p>
<p>And it works especially well for women in their 70's and 80's.</p>
<p>That's because your cells are craving these plant extracts that can't be found in our current food supply.</p>
<p>You can't get Berberine from any fruit or vegetable…</p>
<p>Which is the main activator of AMPk.</p>
<p>In fact, the older you are, the faster it seems to work.</p>
<h3><strong>How long will the discounted packages be available</strong>?</h3>
<p>Honestly, the discounts aren't guaranteed past today.</p>
<p>As we roll out our first large batch of CarboFix, we want to give you the absolute best deal possible.</p>
<p>But we won't be able to do this forever.</p>
<p>Especially with our suppliers and inventory specialists breathing down my neck.</p>
<p>So please take advantage of the discounted rates while you still can.</p>
<p>Because I can't promise they'll be available if you close out of this page and try to come back later.</p>
<p>Simply choose the option that best fits you…</p>
<p>And I'll be waiting on the inside to help you the best I can…</p>
<p>...while your first shipment of CarboFix is on the way.</p>
<p>Take care.</p>
